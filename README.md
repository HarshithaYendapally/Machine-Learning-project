EV Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project aims to analyze and predict Electric Vehicle (EV) sales trends from 2010 to 2024 using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes key features related to EV sales, and the project explores various predictive models to forecast future sales.
The Electric Vehicle (EV) market has seen significant growth in the last decade, with more manufacturers and governments adopting EVs as a sustainable alternative to traditional vehicles. Predicting future trends in EV sales can help manufacturers, policymakers, and investors make informed decisions.

This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze historical EV sales data and predict future trends. Various models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks are evaluated for performance and accuracy.
The following machine learning models have been implemented in this project:

Linear Regression: A simple approach to model the relationship between features and sales.
Decision Tree Regressor: A non-linear approach that models decision rules from data features.
Random Forest: An ensemble of decision trees for more robust predictions.
Neural Networks: A deep learning approach to capture complex patterns in sales data.
